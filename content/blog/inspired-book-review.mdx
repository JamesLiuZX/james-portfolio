# Inspired: Creating Tech Products Customers Love—Beyond the Basics

Marty Cagan's "Inspired" has become gospel in Silicon Valley product circles. But like all gospel, it's often quoted, rarely questioned, and frequently misapplied. After building products at scale, I've found that "Inspired" contains profound truths—and dangerous oversimplifications. Let's examine both.

## The Core Thesis: Product Teams vs. Feature Teams

Cagan's central argument is deceptively simple: **Most companies build the wrong products because they organize around features, not outcomes**.

**Feature Team Model (What most companies do)**:
- Business stakeholders decide what to build
- PM acts as project manager, writing specs
- Team is evaluated on shipping features on time
- Success = shipped the roadmap

**Product Team Model (What Cagan advocates)**:
- Product team is given problems to solve, not features to build
- PM acts as product discovery lead, finding solutions
- Team is evaluated on customer and business outcomes
- Success = moved key metrics

**The Real Insight**: This isn't just an organizational structure debate—it's about where decision-making power lives. Feature teams concentrate power with stakeholders. Product teams distribute power to those closest to customers and technology.

### Why This Is Hard (And Why Most Companies Fail)

Cagan makes empowered product teams sound straightforward. They're not. Here's why:

**1. The Stakeholder Trust Problem**

Empowered teams require stakeholders who trust the team more than they trust their own judgment. This is psychologically difficult, especially for:

- Founders (who built the company on their instincts)
- Sales leaders (who hear customer requests daily)
- Executives (whose careers depend on their strategic vision)

**Solution**: Start with trust-building, not autonomy. Prove the team can solve small problems before asking for authority over strategic ones. Use a "learn-it-first" approach:

- Month 1-2: Feature team mode, but do discovery alongside execution
- Month 3-4: Propose alternative solutions to assigned features
- Month 5-6: Request one small problem to solve autonomously
- Month 7+: Gradually expand problem-solving authority

**2. The Metric Alignment Challenge**

Product teams need clear outcome metrics. But most companies have:
- Conflicting metrics across teams
- Lagging indicators that don't provide fast feedback
- Metrics that don't connect to product decisions

**Example from AskShop.ai**:

We started with "increase merchant revenue" as our success metric. Useless for product decisions. We broke it down:

- **Leading indicator**: Recommendation relevance score (measured within 1 day)
- **Near-term outcome**: Customer engagement with recommendations (measured within 1 week)
- **Medium-term outcome**: Conversion rate improvement (measured within 1 month)
- **Lagging indicator**: Merchant revenue increase (measured within 3 months)

Each product decision could be evaluated against the leading indicator within days, not months.

**3. The Skill Gap Reality**

Empowered teams require PMs with both:
- **Discovery skills**: Customer research, prototyping, experimentation
- **Delivery skills**: Prioritization, stakeholder management, execution

Most PMs are strong in one, weak in the other. Cagan assumes you can simply "hire better," but:

- Strong discovery PMs often struggle with execution velocity
- Strong delivery PMs often skip discovery entirely

**Solution**: Pair complementary PMs, or explicitly allocate time (40% discovery, 60% delivery) and measure both.

## The Four Big Risks Framework

Cagan identifies four risks every product must address:

1. **Value risk**: Will customers buy it / choose to use it?
2. **Usability risk**: Can customers figure out how to use it?
3. **Feasibility risk**: Can we build it?
4. **Business viability risk**: Does it work for our business?

**What Cagan Gets Right**: These risks aren't sequential—they must be addressed in parallel. Most teams only focus on feasibility and ignore the others until launch.

**What Cagan Understates**: The relative importance of these risks varies dramatically by company stage:

### Early Stage (0-10 people)
- **Value risk**: 70% of focus
- **Feasibility risk**: 20%
- **Usability risk**: 10%
- **Viability risk**: 0% (survival is the only viability metric)

You must prove people want the thing before worrying about anything else. "Build something people want" isn't a platitude—it's the only thing that matters.

### Growth Stage (10-100 people)
- **Value risk**: 40%
- **Usability risk**: 30%
- **Feasibility risk**: 20%
- **Viability risk**: 10%

You've proven value; now you must scale it. Usability becomes critical because you can't onboard every user personally.

### Scale Stage (100-1000 people)
- **Viability risk**: 40%
- **Feasibility risk**: 30%
- **Usability risk**: 20%
- **Value risk**: 10%

You have product-market fit; now you must build sustainable unit economics and avoid technical debt collapse. Many founders hate this stage because it's less about vision and more about optimization.

### Enterprise Stage (1000+ people)
- **Viability risk**: 50%
- **Feasibility risk**: 30%
- **Usability risk**: 15%
- **Value risk**: 5%

You're optimizing business model and managing technical complexity. New value creation is rare—most "new features" are table stakes to avoid churn.

## Product Discovery: Beyond the Cargo Cult

Cagan's product discovery framework is excellent—and dangerously easy to implement badly.

### The Discovery Techniques

1. **Customer interviews** (qualitative feedback)
2. **Prototypes** (test usability before building)
3. **A/B tests** (measure actual behavior)
4. **Data analysis** (understand usage patterns)

**The Cargo Cult Problem**: Teams do these activities without understanding their purpose. I've seen teams that:

- Interview customers but don't let insights change roadmap
- Build prototypes but not for testing hypotheses
- Run A/B tests but ship winners regardless of statistical significance
- Analyze data but don't connect findings to decisions

### The Discovery Cadence That Actually Works

Most summaries present discovery as a phase before development. Cagan knows better, but doesn't emphasize enough: **Discovery and delivery must happen in parallel, continuously**.

**The Two-Track System**:

**Discovery Track** (30-40% of PM time):
- Week N: Research 3-5 problem areas
- Week N+1: Prototype 2-3 potential solutions
- Week N+2: Test prototypes with 8-12 users
- Week N+3: Synthesize learnings, recommend next problems to solve

**Delivery Track** (60-70% of PM time):
- Shipping features validated 4-6 weeks ago in discovery
- Measuring impact of recently shipped features
- Iterating on live features based on data

**Critical Insight**: Discovery is always 4-6 weeks ahead of delivery. When discovery fails, you don't notice until you launch the thing 6 weeks later and it flops.

### The Prototype Fidelity Spectrum

Cagan distinguishes prototypes from MVPs, but doesn't go deep enough on fidelity levels:

**Level 1: Value Prop Test** (1 hour)
- Landing page with description
- Tests: Will anyone click "Sign up"?

**Level 2: Usability Test** (1 day)
- Clickable Figma mockup
- Tests: Can users complete the task?

**Level 3: Technical Feasibility Test** (3-5 days)
- Functional prototype, manual backend
- Tests: Does the technical approach work?

**Level 4: Demand Test** (1-2 weeks)
- Limited working feature for 10-50 users
- Tests: Will people actually use this repeatedly?

**Level 5: MVP** (4-8 weeks)
- Scalable implementation
- Tests: Can we build a sustainable business?

**The Mistake**: Jumping from Level 1 to Level 5. Each level should kill 70-80% of ideas, dramatically reducing waste.

## The Product Discovery Anti-Patterns

From working with dozens of product teams, here are the most common discovery failures:

### Anti-Pattern 1: Solution-First Discovery

Team already knows what to build; discovery is used to justify the decision.

**Symptoms**:
- Research questions are leading: "What would you think of a feature that does X?"
- Negative evidence is dismissed: "That customer doesn't understand the value"
- Success is measured by agreement: "8/10 customers said they'd use it!"

**Fix**: Start with problem research, not solution validation. Ask "What's hard about X?" not "Would you use a tool that does Y?"

### Anti-Pattern 2: Analysis Paralysis

Team does endless research, never commits to building anything.

**Symptoms**:
- "We need more data" is the response to every decision
- Prototypes get more sophisticated instead of tested
- Team celebrates learning over shipping

**Fix**: Time-box discovery. After 2 weeks of research, you must make a bet and test it. Learning is only valuable if it leads to action.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Ignoring Revealed Preference

Team trusts what customers *say* over what customers *do*.

**Symptoms**:
- Features customers requested sit unused after launch
- Qualitative feedback contradicts quantitative data
- Team surprised by low adoption despite positive interviews

**Fix**: Weight behavioral data 10x more than stated preferences. If customers say they want X but don't use it when you build it, believe the behavior.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Discovery Theater

Team does discovery activities but doesn't actually derisk the product.

**Symptoms**:
- Discovery doesn't kill ideas, just tweaks them
- Same ideas keep resurfacing despite negative evidence
- Team can't articulate what they learned from discovery

**Fix**: Set explicit "kill criteria" before starting discovery. "If fewer than 30% of users complete the task in prototype testing, we won't build this."

## The Product Strategy Component

Cagan introduces product strategy as a critical missing piece in most organizations. He's right, but his framework needs updating for modern product development.

### The Classical Product Strategy Stack

Cagan suggests:
1. **Product vision**: Where are we going? (long-term, 3-10 years)
2. **Product strategy**: How will we get there? (medium-term, 1-3 years)
3. **Product objectives**: What will we achieve this quarter?
4. **Product backlog**: What will we build this sprint?

**The Problem**: This assumes strategy can be planned 1-3 years out. In practice:
- Technology changes faster than strategy cycles
- Competitors force reactive strategy shifts
- Customer needs evolve unpredictably

### The Adaptive Product Strategy Stack

A better model for fast-moving products:

**1. Product Vision** (3-10 years, rarely changes)
- Who will we serve?
- What job will we do for them?
- Why will we win?

Example: "Help e-commerce stores convert more browsers into buyers through AI-powered product discovery."

**2. Strategic Themes** (6-12 months, reviewed quarterly)
- 3-5 major problem areas to solve
- Each theme has clear success metrics

Example themes:
- Reduce merchant onboarding time from 2 hours to 15 minutes
- Increase recommendation relevance score from 65% to 80%
- Expand from fashion to home goods category

**3. Bets** (4-8 weeks, continuous)
- Specific hypotheses about how to move metrics
- Time-boxed experiments with clear success criteria

Example bet: "If we allow merchants to customize AI personality, onboarding completion will increase from 60% to 75%."

**4. Features** (1-2 weeks, continuous delivery)
- Smallest shippable increments that test bets
- Measured immediately against bet success criteria

**The Key Difference**: Instead of planning features for the year, you're planning problems for the quarter and experimenting with solutions continuously.

## The Role of Product Leadership

Cagan's chapter on product leadership is the most underrated in the book. Here's what actually matters:

### Context Setting > Direction Setting

Bad product leaders give direction: "Build this feature."

Good product leaders give context: "Here's why this metric matters, here's how it connects to company strategy, here's the constraints we're operating under."

Empowered teams need context, not commands.

### The Weekly Product Leadership Cadence

**Monday: Context Broadcast**
- Share company priorities and constraints
- Highlight metrics that matter this week
- Surface risks and dependencies

**Wednesday: Problem Review**
- Teams present problems they're solving
- Leaders ask clarifying questions, don't give solutions
- Check for strategic alignment

**Friday: Learning Share**
- Teams present what they learned from discovery
- Celebrate killed ideas (you want teams to kill ideas early)
- Identify patterns across teams

### The PM Career Ladder Anti-Pattern

Many companies treat PM career progression as: IC PM → Senior PM → Lead PM → Group PM → Director → VP

**The Problem**: This creates incentives to manage people instead of products. The best PMs often make terrible managers.

**Better Model**: Dual track progression

**Technical/Individual Track**:
- PM → Senior PM → Staff PM → Principal PM
- Increasing product complexity and strategic importance
- No people management required

**Leadership Track**:
- PM → Senior PM → Lead PM → Director
- Increasing organizational scope
- Product strategy and people development

## What Inspired Gets Wrong (Or Outdated)

### 1. The OKR Obsession

Cagan strongly advocates for OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). In practice:

**Problems with OKRs**:
- Teams game the metrics (you get what you measure)
- Quarterly cycles are too slow for learning
- Key Results often become features in disguise

**Better Approach**: Use continuous metric tracking with weekly review cycles. Set thresholds ("We need recommendation relevance above 75%") not targets ("Increase recommendation relevance by 10%").

### 2. The "Products Over Projects" Dogma

Cagan dismisses project-based product management entirely. But sometimes you *need* to ship a feature by a deadline:

- Contractual obligations to customers
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Platform deprecations with hard cutoff dates
- Competitive features that are table stakes

**Reality**: The best product teams flex between product mode (outcome-oriented) and project mode (deadline-oriented) based on context.

### 3. The Dismissal of Top-Down Innovation

Cagan is skeptical of executive-driven product direction. But some of the best products came from top-down vision:

- iPhone: Steve Jobs' vision, not customer research
- AWS: Jeff Bezos' bet, not developer feedback
- Tesla: Elon Musk's conviction, not market demand

**Truth**: Bottom-up discovery is great for optimizing existing products. Top-down vision is sometimes necessary for category creation.

### 4. The "Seat at the Table" Trap

Cagan argues PMs should have equal standing with engineering and design. This sounds good but creates:

- Endless debates about who gets final say
- Slower decision-making
- Political maneuvering for power

**Better Model**: Rotate decision-making authority based on the type of decision:

- **Design-led decisions**: Visual design, interaction patterns, information architecture
- **Engineering-led decisions**: Technical architecture, build vs. buy, technology choices
- **Product-led decisions**: Prioritization, problem selection, success metrics

## Implementing Inspired: A Practical Guide

Here's how to actually transform a feature team into a product team:

### Phase 1: Small Wins (Month 1-2)

Don't ask for full autonomy. Instead:

**Step 1**: Pick one small feature from the roadmap
**Step 2**: Do discovery alongside building it
**Step 3**: Present "Here's what we learned" alongside "Here's what we shipped"
**Step 4**: Show how learnings would have changed the approach

**Goal**: Demonstrate discovery value without threatening stakeholders.

### Phase 2: Alternative Proposals (Month 3-4)

**Step 1**: For one roadmap feature, propose an alternative solution
**Step 2**: Show why it better addresses the underlying problem
**Step 3**: Get stakeholder buy-in to test both approaches
**Step 4**: Let data decide

**Goal**: Prove the team can find better solutions than stakeholders.

### Phase 3: Problem Ownership (Month 5-6)

**Step 1**: Request one problem to solve autonomously
**Step 2**: Commit to specific metric movement
**Step 3**: Run full discovery process
**Step 4**: Ship solution and measure impact

**Goal**: Build trust in team's ability to solve problems end-to-end.

### Phase 4: Strategic Contribution (Month 7+)

**Step 1**: Propose a strategic theme based on customer insights
**Step 2**: Outline how it connects to company goals
**Step 3**: Request resources to pursue it
**Step 4**: Deliver results

**Goal**: Evolve from executing strategy to shaping it.

## The Inspired Scorecard: How Product-Team Are You?

Rate your team on these dimensions (1-5 scale):

### Discovery Maturity
- **1**: No discovery, build what stakeholders request
- **2**: Interview customers after building features
- **3**: Interview customers before building, but don't change plans
- **4**: Regular discovery that sometimes changes plans
- **5**: Continuous discovery that frequently kills ideas

### Outcome Orientation
- **1**: Success = shipped on time
- **2**: Success = feature adoption
- **3**: Success = specific metric movement
- **4**: Success = sustained metric improvement
- **5**: Success = business impact (revenue, retention, efficiency)

### Team Empowerment
- **1**: Team executes a feature roadmap
- **2**: Team can propose alternative solutions to roadmap items
- **3**: Team owns problems but within predefined scope
- **4**: Team proposes problems to solve
- **5**: Team shapes product strategy

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
- **1**: PM writes specs, throws over wall to eng/design
- **2**: Regular check-ins during development
- **3**: Eng/design in discovery, but PM leads
- **4**: True collaboration in discovery and delivery
- **5**: Rotating decision-making authority based on problem type

**Scoring**:
- **4-8**: Feature team (start with Phase 1)
- **9-12**: Hybrid team (start with Phase 2)
- **13-16**: Emerging product team (start with Phase 3)
- **17-20**: Mature product team (focus on scaling)

## The Future: What Comes After Inspired?

Product management is evolving beyond Cagan's model:

### 1. AI-Augmented Discovery

AI can now:
- Analyze thousands of support tickets to identify patterns
- Generate and test hundreds of copy variations
- Predict which features will drive retention

**Impact**: Discovery cycles compress from weeks to days.

### 2. Continuous Deployment as Default

With feature flags and gradual rollouts:
- Every commit can go to production
- A/B testing happens automatically
- "Releases" become irrelevant

**Impact**: The line between discovery and delivery disappears entirely.

### 3. Product-Led Growth Changes PM Role

When products self-serve:
- Activation becomes more important than features
- Virality mechanisms become product features
- Pricing is a product decision, not a business decision

**Impact**: PMs must deeply understand conversion funnels and growth mechanics.

## Conclusion: Inspired as a Starting Point, Not Gospel

"Inspired" provides an excellent framework for product management. But frameworks are maps, not territory. The best product teams:

**1. Start with Inspired principles**:
- Solve problems, not features
- Empower teams with context and authority
- Use continuous discovery to derisk products

**2. Adapt to their context**:
- Company stage (early vs. growth vs. scale)
- Market type (B2C vs. B2B vs. B2B2C)
- Team maturity (feature team vs. product team)

**3. Evolve beyond the framework**:
- Add practices that work for them
- Remove practices that don't fit
- Continuously experiment with process

The goal isn't to be "Inspired compliant"—it's to build products customers love. Sometimes that means following Cagan's playbook. Sometimes it means ignoring it.

The best PMs know the difference.
